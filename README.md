# atlworkforcedev

Project for Atlanta Workforce Dev/Suit Swap

We are taking the existing site from below, and moving it to a more stand alone, less gonverment type website. We aim to have a simple url that is both reslient enough to deal with constant use from a CRM type platform, yet be accessible to users with mobile phones only. 

The idea for the site is to allow people who are in a tough spot the ability to get a suit, career coaching, resume assistance, interview prep and other services to help them re-enter the job force. 

What we are using to build the site:

Site which we are drawing from: http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=889
Simple MVC framework: http://simplemvcframework.com/php-framework
Twitter Bootstrap: getbootstrap.com
Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Vagrant Box docs: box.scotch.io

Tools we recommend:
PHPStorm or Sublime Text
Sequel Pro
Vagrant
